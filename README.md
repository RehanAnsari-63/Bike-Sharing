# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the demand for bike rentals using historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze various factors like weather conditions, time of the day, and seasonal effects to build a predictive model.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset contains key variables such as:  
- **Date & Time** – Timestamp of the rental  
- **Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed** – Weather conditions  
- **Season, Holiday, Working Day** – Temporal factors  
- **Registered & Casual Users** – Count of bike users  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Regression models, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost  

## 📌 Key Features  
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Model selection & hyperparameter tuning  
✅ Performance evaluation using RMSE, R² score  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike-sharing-demand.git
   cd bike-sharing-demand
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
